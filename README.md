# Crud-Operation


This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to perform CRUD operations on user data (name, email, and city). The project follows a RESTful API design and demonstrates basic database interactions using MongoDB with Mongoose.

#Key features include:

Create: Add new users to the database.

Read: Get a list of all users or retrieve a user by their ID.

Update: Modify existing user details.

Delete: Remove a user from the database.

The backend is structured using Express for routing, and Mongoose for interacting with MongoDB. The app also supports error handling and data validation for smooth operations.

#Technologies Used:

Express.js

MongoDB (via Mongoose)

Postman (for API testing)

dotenv (for environment variables)
